Hello! I go by Cleo Jing, using `AtomAlpaca` as social media handle.

A normal senior high school student, interested in Computer Science and Mathematics.

Once was an OIer, got a full brain for algorithms and nearly no rewards from it. Find me at [Luogu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/374500) or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/AtomAlpaca).

## Currently working on
- [Wave](https://github.com/AtomAlpaca/Wave), a lightweight Android app for tracking mood changes, developed using Jetpack Compose.
- My own [website](https://www.atal.moe) and [blog](https://blog.atal.moe), where I primarily write about algorithms and Mathematics.
- Occasionally write some pages for [OI-wiki](https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki)
